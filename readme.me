# DE25 Lab 1 – Programming in Data Platform Development “Data Ingestion, manipulation & workflow”

**Student:** Christophe Giraud  
**Course:** Data Platform Development  
**Lessons covered:** #6 (ETL & Pipeline Theory), #7 (Pandas & Batch Files), #8 (Stories, Planning & Transform Workshop)  
**Date:** February 2026


## Overview

This lab is about processing product data using **Pandas** in a simple **ETL** process (Extract → Transform → Load):

- Extract: Read product data from "lab1_data.csv" (original name was products.csv)
- Transform: Clean the data, fix types, handle missing values, flag problems (missing currency, price = 0, negative/extreme prices), reject impossible rows
- Load: Save summary statistics and analysis files as CSV

No database (PostgreSQL/Psycopg3) or API (FastAPI) is used here — this lab is file-based only


## Repository Files

- "lab1_data.csv"                   – Raw input file (products with name, price, currency, etc.)
- "labbet.ipynb"                    – Main Jupyter Notebook: full lab code (reading, cleaning, flagging, rejecting, analytics)
- "teori_theory.ipynb"              – Theory notes from lessons
- "analytics_summary.csv"           – Final summary: average price, median price, total products, products with missing price
- "price_analysis_version1.csv"     – First version of bonus price analysis (top 10 expensive + outliers)
- "price_analysis_version2.csv"     – Second version with a different way to do it (trick)
- "rejected_products.csv"           – All rejected/impossible products
- "Doc/"                            – Folder with screenshots of my first attempt to get the top_10_expensive and top_10_outliers. 
- "sources.md"                      – List of sources


## How to run it

1. **Clone the repository** 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/giraudcgc-cpu/DE25_Labb1_Programmering_Data_platform_Christophe_Giraud.git
   cd DE25_Labb1_Programmering_Data_platform_Christophe_Giraud

OR 
2. Create and activate a virtual environment with: 
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies (only pandas is needed). From bash or the Terminal: pip install pandas

4. Finaly, Open labbet.ipynb in VS Code (with Jupyter extension) and run all cells from top to bottom


--- What I Learned ---

- To Build a basic ETL pipeline using only Pandas
- The importance of cleaning and rejecting bad data before analysis
- How to detect outliers (sort by price vs. deviation from median)
- To export results (DataFrames) to CSV files

Question 6: Create a file price_analysis.csv (bonus) including:
• top 10 dyraste produkter
• top 10 produkter med mest avvikande pris 

At first, I wrote a code (see under Doc) and the issue was that both top_10_expensive and top_10_outliers 
gave the result, the highest prices ignoring the lowest prices.  

Codes:
top_10_expensive = pd.DataFrame(accepted_df).sort_values(by=["price"], ascending=False).head(10).copy()

outliers_df = accepted_df.copy()
median_price = outliers_df["price"].median()
outliers_df["deviation"] = (outliers_df["price"] - median_price).abs()
top_10_outliers_df = outliers_df.sort_values(by="deviation", ascending=False).head(10)
